"These images come from the book, An Anatomical Guide to Monsters, 1967, 1997. The book's text and original concepts are attributed to Shoji Otomo, the man who pioneered the whole "kaiju biology" penomenon (more easily understandable for English speakers: "strange beast biology" or "monster biology" relating to those monsters from the old Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan, Mothra days... if you are a geek like I am). The illustrations to Shogo Endo, an accomplished animator and illustrator." [source](http://topics2008.blogspot.co.il/2008/12/shogo-endo-and-shoji-otomo-emilys-pick.html)
